            <h1>SAMBA</h1>

            <p><span class="highlight">Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)</span> is the environmental quality of a
                building, and is important to
                occupant comfort, health and productivity. <span class="highlight">SAMBA</span> is an IEQ monitoring
                system developed by Tom Parkinson.
                This small and inconspicuous device - pictured right - offers continuous monitoring of a range of IEQ
                factors across the day, and is relatively cheap.
            </p>

            <p>The SAMBA device works by taking measurements of its environment at multiple intervals in a day. Multiple
                SAMBAs from a floor in a building will combine their data, which is then sent to a third party device
                where it is uploaded to a cloud. This allows you to monitor data to see if your environmental quality is
                up to standard for maximised efficiency.</p>
