            <p>Welcome to the SAMBAmate web application! Let's run through what IEQ is and why it's so important, and
                how
                you can utilise your SAMBA device/s to improve your IEQ!</p>

            <p>Enjoying the blast of aircon on a hot day, or staying cozy during winter - these aren’t only a matter of
                comfort, but of productivity too. You spend an average of a third of your day at work, making thermal
                comfort at work especially important. With the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change, this
                topic is increasingly relevant.
            </p>

            <p><span class="lightpink">Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)</span> is concerned with how 4 aspects impact
                health and wellbeing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Acoustics</li>
                <li>Indoor air quality</li>
                <li>Lighting</li>
                <li>Thermal comfort</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Out of these, <span class="lightpink">thermal comfort</span>, the satisfaction occupants feel towards
                their
                thermal environment, is
                considered the most important. Thermal comfort affects morale, productivity and health. Hence, there are
                several standards and guidelines for IEQ, including ASHRAE 55.
            </p>

            <p class="beige">As SAMBA is a valuable IEQ data collecting device, all of the graphs in this experience
                averages
                SAMBA data from different offices and floors across Sydney in 2019, hence presenting an overview of the
                typical office IEQ across the year.

            <p>The slider you just completed is known as <span class="lightpink">Predicted Mean Vote (PMV).</span></p>

            <p>PMV is an important measure of IEQ, as it pertains to the measure of perceived human comfort and hence
                can be
                used to
                predict productivity.
            </p>

            <p>A -3 value is too cold and a +3 value is too hot. A 0 value is perfect, which occurs when your heat
                production and heat loss are equal, and is referred to as thermal equilibrium. To comply with ASHRAE 55,
                PMV
                must not exceed a ±0.5 value.

                1.5 degrees, yet offices
                across the different floors and zones tested by SAMBA averaged at a much higher 24.03 degrees (that's

                        is not uniform, this data is a
                        rough average made from averaging the minimum and maximum values recorded in Sydney, and is not

                        as a mean average taken at intervals across the day. But for our purposes, this is a good

            <p>Firstly, there are many factors that can affect the actual air temperature, as well as PMV. These factors
                include the following: radiant air temperature, air speed and humidity.</p>

            <p>We will dive into definitions and
                explanations later, but for now, take a guess:</p>

        <section id="section8">
            <p><span class="lightpink">Mean radiant temperature</span> refers to the heat radiating from a person or
                object
                and out into their immediate
                environment. Mean radiant temperature and air temperature are strongly correlated, and in turn, air
                temperature is <b>strongly related</b> to PMV. This is often why radiant temperature is assumed to equal
                the
                room
                temperature.</p>

            <div id="airtemp_tmrt_graph"></div>

            <p>You can see in the graph above, that in the winter months, the mean radiant temperature is slightly
                higher
                than the air temperature, as during this time the body temperature of occupants is increased through
                automatic physiological behaviours.</p>

            <p><span class="blue">Lower air speed</span> does not affect the actual air temperature, or the radiant
                temperature, but it does affect
                the perceived temperature. Additionally, lower air speed may cause fatigue and contributes to a higher
                PMV,
                although <b>much less</b> than the other factors.
            </p>

            <div id="airspeed_pmv_graph"></div>

            <p>This means that in the graph above, the average temperature of 24.03 that SAMBA recorded, is likely to

            <p>If it’s too high, it can cause sweating, tiredness and a feeling of airlessness. And if humidity
                reaches over 80% it can even cause heat-related illness or injury, since sweat cannot evaporate at this
                high
                percentage. Humidity below 40% - as seen in most of this graph - can exasperate respiratory conditions

                temperature,
                air
                speed and humidity. However, SAMBA records other IEQ data, including data that relates to the other

                facets
                of IEQ (acoustics, indoor air quality and lighting), including globe temperature, sound level, light

                level and predicted percentage dissatisfied.</p>

            <p>Now that we can see how and why PMV is too high or low for productivity, and we can record and review
