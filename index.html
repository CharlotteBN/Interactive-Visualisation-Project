        <h1 class="mainHeading">How to improve your IEQ with SAMBA</h1>

        <p>Enjoying the blast of aircon on a hot day, or staying cozy during winter - these arenâ€™t only a matter of
            comfort, but of productivity too. You spend an average of a third of your day at work, making thermal
            comfort at work especially important. With the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change, this
            topic is increasingly relevant.
        </p>

        <p><span class="lightpink">Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ)</span> is concerned with how 4 aspects impact
            occupant health and wellbeing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Acoustics</li>
            <li>Indoor air quality</li>
            <li>Lighting</li>
            <li>Thermal comfort</li>

        </ol>
        <p>Out of these, <span class="lightpink">thermal comfort</span>, the satisfaction occupants feel towards their
            thermal environment, is
            considered the most important. Thermal comfort affects morale, productivity and health. Hence, there are
            several standards and guidelines for IEQ, including ASHRAE 55.
        </p>

        <p class="beige">As SAMBA is a valuable IEQ data collecting tool, all of the data variables in this experience
            averages SAMBA
            data from different offices and floors across Sydney, hence presenting an overview of the typical office
            IEQ.

        <p>Letâ€™s reflect on your IEQ.</p>

        <div class="slidercontainer">
            <h2>How are you feeling right now?</h2>
            <p id="sliderlabeltwo"></p>
            <input type="range" min="-3" max="3" value="0" step="0.1" class="slider" id="myRange">

            <p id="demo"></p>
            <button id="submit">Submit</button>

    <section id="section3">
        <p>The slider you just completed is known as <span class="lightpink">Predicted Mean Vote (PMV).</span></p>

        <p>PMV is an important measure of IEQ, as it pertains to the measure of percieved human comfort and hence can be used to
            predict productivity.
        </p>

        <p>A -3 value is too cold and a +3 value is too hot. A 0 value is perfect, which occurs when your heat
            production and heat loss are equal, and is referred to as thermal equilibrium. To comply with ASHRAE 55, PMV
            must not exceed a Â±0.5 value.
        </p>

        <div id="airtemp_pmv_graph"></div>

        <p>As you can see in the graph above, this means that <span class="pink">PMV</span> correlates with <span
                class="blue">air temperature</span>.
        </p>
        <a href="#section4" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>
    </section>

    <section id="section4">
        <p>Now that you understand PMV, letâ€™s see how <span class="hotpink">you</span> compared to the PMV that SAMBA
            has recorded!</p>
        <div id="custom_graph"></div>
        <p id=custom_effect class="beige"></p>
        <a href="#section5" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>

    <section id="section5">
        <div id="indoor_outdoor_graph"></div>
        <p>The <span class="navy">ideal indoor environment</span> should be 22 degrees, with an allowable deviance of
            1.5 degrees, yet offices
            across the different floors and zones tested by SAMBA averaged at a much higher 24.03 degrees.
        </p>

        <p>When this is compared to the <span class="pink tooltip">average outdoor temperature,<span class="tooltiptext">Outdoor temperature data courtesy of ACORN-SAT. Because temperature across a day is not uniform, this data is a
            rough average made from averaging the minimum and maximum values recorded in Sydney, and is not as accurate
            as a mean average taken at intervals across the day. But for our purposes, this is a good estimated average
            outdoor temperature.</span></span> we can see that across
            the year there is greater
            variation compared to <span class="blue">indoor temperature.</span> The indoor temperature only slightly
            correlates to these outdoor
            temperatures.
        </p>

        <p class="beige">So, if indoor spaces are easier to maintain, why arenâ€™t they maintained at the right
            temperatures?

        <a href="#section6" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>

    <section id="section6">
        <p>Firstly, there are many factors that can affect the actual air temperature, as well as PMV. These factors
            include the following: radiant air temperature, air speed and humidity.</p>

        <p>We will dive into definitions and
            explanations later, but for now, a little quiz:</p>

        <div id="quiz">
            <div id="question"></div>
            <div id="options"></div>
        </div>
        <a href="#section7" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>
    </section>

    <section id="section7">
        <p><span class="lightpink">Mean radiant temperature</span> refers to the heat radiating from a person or object
            and out into their immediate
            environment. Mean radiant temperature and air temperature are strongly correlated, and in turn, air
            temperature is strongly related to PMV. This is often why radiant temperature is assumed to equal the room
            temperature.</p>

        <div id="airtemp_tmrt_graph"></div>

        <p>You can see in the graph above, that in the winter months, the mean radiant temperature is slightly higher
            than the air temperature, as during this time the body temperature of occupants is increased through
            automatic physiological behaviours.</p>
        <a href="#section8" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>
    </section>

    <section id="section8">
        <p><span class="blue">Lower air speed</span> does not affect the actual air temperature, or the radiant
            temperature, but it does affect
            the perceived temperature. Additionally, lower air speed may cause fatigue and contributes to a higher PMV,
            although not as significantly as the other factors.
        </p>

        <div id="airspeed_pmv_graph"></div>

        <p>This means that in the graph above, the average temperature of 24.03 that SAMBA recorded, is likely to feel
            even hotter to the occupants.</p>
        <a href="#section9" class="arrow">ðŸ¡£</a>
    </section>

    <section id="section9">
        <p><span class="blue">Humidity</span> is how much water vapor is in air. It is most strongly correlated to <span
                class="lightpink">PMV</span> because of how it affects
            people.</p>

        <p>If itâ€™s too high, it can cause sweating, tiredness and a feeling of airlessness. And if humidity
            reaches over 80% it can even cause heat-related illness or injury, since sweat cannot evaporate at this high
            percentage. Humidity below 40% - as seen in most of this graph - can exasperate respiratory conditions
            including sinusitis, and cause dry eyes.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <p>This article focused on the thermal comfort aspects of IEQ - PMV, air temperature, radiant air temperature,
            air
            speed and humidity. However, SAMBA records other IEQ data, including data that relates to the other three
            facets
            of IEQ (acoustics, indoor air quality and lighting), including globe temperature, sound level, light level,
            CO2
            level and predicted percentage dissatisfied.</p>

        <p>Now that we can see how and why PMV is too high or low for productivity, and we can record and review your
            workplace IEQ data using SAMBA - What can be done to improve it?</p>
